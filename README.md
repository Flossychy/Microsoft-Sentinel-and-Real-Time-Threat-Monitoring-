# **Implementing Microsoft Sentinel for Real-Time Threat Monitoring and Incident Response**

## **Overview**

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution. It empowers organizations to collect, detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents in real time. This project demonstrates how Microsoft Sentinel can be implemented to enhance security monitoring and incident response capabilities, focusing on integration with Microsoft Entra ID for data collection.

---

## **Key Features and Benefits**
- **Data Collection**: Integration with Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Activity Logs, and other sources for centralized log collection.
- **Threat Detection**: Custom analytic rules for detecting security threats such as brute force attacks.
- **Incident Response**: Automated workflows using playbooks created in Azure Logic Apps for prompt response.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Real-time alerts and dashboards for continuous visibility.

---

## **Architecture and Components**
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Centralized SIEM/SOAR solution.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Source for sign-in and audit logs.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Automation for incident response.
- **Log Analytics Workspace**: Core data repository for Sentinel.


---

## **Project Steps**

### **1. Setting Up Microsoft Sentinel**
#### **Step 1.1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace**
- Navigate to the Azure portal.
- Search for "Log Analytics Workspaces" and create a new workspace.
- Provide a name, region, subscription, and resource group.
- Review and deploy the workspace.

#### **Step 1.2: Enable Microsoft Sentinel**
- Navigate to Microsoft Sentinel in Azure.
- Select the created Log Analytics Workspace and enable Sentinel.


---

### **2. Data Collection with Microsoft Entra ID**
#### **Step 2.1: Configure the Data Connector**
- Navigate to **Configuration > Data Connectors** in the Sentinel workspace.
- Search for **Microsoft Entra ID** and open the connector page.
- Enable "Sign-In Logs" and "Audit Logs".
- Save the configuration.

#### **Step 2.2: Verify Data Ingestion**
- Use the following KQL query in the Logs section to confirm ingestion:
  ```kql
  SigninLogs
  | take 10
  ```


---

### **3. Configuring Analytic Rules**
#### **Step 3.1: Detecting Brute Force Attacks**
- Create a **Scheduled Query Rule** in the Sentinel workspace.
- Set up the following KQL query:
  ```kql
  SecurityEvent
  | where EventID == 4625
  | summarize AttemptCount = count() by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
  | where AttemptCount > 5
  ```
- Set frequency to 30 minutes and lookup period to 5 hours.

#### **Step 3.2: Detecting Multi-Login Attempts**
- Use KQL to identify multiple logins from different IP addresses:
  ```kql
  SigninLogs
  | summarize LoginCount = count() by IPAddress, UserPrincipalName
  | where LoginCount > 3
  ```


---

### **4. Automating Incident Response**
#### **Step 4.1: Create Automation Rules**
- Define criteria to trigger automation (e.g., severity level).
- Add actions such as tagging incidents or assigning to a team.

#### **Step 4.2: Build Playbooks with Azure Logic Apps**
- Design a playbook triggered by Sentinel incidents.
- Add actions to send email alerts or log incidents in other systems.

---

### **5. Simulating Threat Scenarios**
#### **Scenario 1: Brute Force Attack**
- Simulate failed login attempts to trigger the brute force detection rule.

#### **Scenario 2: Multi-Login from Different IPs**
- Use a script to generate login attempts from multiple IP addresses.


---

## **Best Practices**
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Leverage playbooks for incident response.
- **Keep Rules Updated**: Regularly update analytics to match evolving threats.
- **Optimize Performance**: Continuously monitor system performance and cost.

---

## **Challenges and Mitigation**
### **Challenges**
- Steep learning curve for configuring Sentinel and Azure Logic Apps.
- Initial integration complexity with Microsoft Entra ID.

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Utilize Microsoft documentation and tutorials for guidance.
- Divide tasks among team members to leverage individual strengths.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Microsoft Sentinel**
- **Microsoft Entra ID**
- **Azure Logic Apps**
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**

---

## **Conclusion**
This project highlights the power of Microsoft Sentinel for proactive threat detection and response. By integrating Microsoft Entra ID, configuring custom analytics, and automating responses with playbooks, we demonstrated how to secure an organization's digital assets effectively.
